Escape
======

Escape is a UNIX-like microkernel operating system on which I'm working since
october 2008. It's implemented in C, C++ and a bit assembler. Except that
I'm using the bootloader GRUB and the libraries that GCC provides (libgcc,
libsupc++), I've developed the whole OS by myself.  
Escape runs on x86, ECO32 and MMIX.
[ECO32](http://homepages.thm.de/~hg53/eco32/) is a 32-bit big-endian RISC
architecture, created by Hellwig Geisse at the University of Applied Sciences
in Gie√üen for research and teaching purposes.
MMIX is a 64-bit big-endian RISC architecture, developed by Donald Knuth as
the successor of MIX, which is the abstract machine that is used in the famous
bookseries The Art of Computer Programming. More precisely, Escape runs only
on [GIMMIX](http://homepages.thm.de/~hg53/gimmix/), a simulator for MMIX
developed by myself for my master thesis (the differences are minimal, but
currently required for Escape).  

If you just want to take a quick look, you'll find

the wiki.


General structure
-----------------

Escape consists of a kernel, drivers, libraries and user-applications. The
kernel is responsible for processes, threads, memory-management, a virtual
file system (VFS) and some other things. Drivers run in user-space and work
via message-passing. They do not necessarily access the hardware and should
therefore more seen as an instance that provides a service.  
The VFS is one of the central points of Escape. Besides the opportunity to
create files and folders in it, it is used to provide information about the
state of the system for the user-space (memory-usage, CPU, running
processes, ...). Most important, the VFS is used to communicate with devices,
which are registered and handled by drivers. That means, each device gets
a node in the VFS over which it can be accessed. So, for example an
`open("/dev/zero",...)` would open the device "zero". Afterwards one can use
the received file-descriptor to communicate with it.  
Basically, the communication works over messages. Escape provides the
system-calls `send` and `receive` for that purpose. Additionally, Escape defines
standard-messages for `open`, `read`, `write` and `close`, which devices
may support. For example, when using the `read` system-call with a
file-descriptor for a device, Escape will send the read-standard-message to
the corresponding device and handle the communication for the user-program.
As soon as the answer is available, the result is passed back to the
user-program that called `read`.  
The same mechanism is used for "real" filesystems (on a disk, cd, ...), which
can be mounted somewhere in the VFS. If a file is opened which belongs to one
of these mounted filesystems, the kernel will handle the communication with
the driver that has been registers as being responsible for this filesystem.  
Because of this mechanism the user-space doesn't have to distinguish between
virtual files, "real" files and devices. So, for example the tool cat can
simply do an `open` and use `read` to read from that file and `write` to
write to stdout.  
 
Features
--------

Escape has currently the following features:

* **Kernel**
    * Memory-management supporting copy-on-write, text-sharing,
      shared-libraries, shared-memory, mapping of physical mem (e.g. VESA-mem),
      demand-loading, swapping and thread-local-storage
    * Process- and thread-management, event-system, ELF-loader, environment-
      variables, scheduler, signal-management (signals are also used to pass
      interrupts to drivers) and timer-management (for sleeping and
      preemption)
    * SMP-support, CPU-detection and CPU-speed-calculation, FPU-support
      VM86-task to perform BIOS-calls
    * Virtual file system for driver-access, accessing the real-filesystem,
      creating virtual files and directories, using pipes and providing
      information about the system (memory-usage, cpu, running processes, ...)
    * Debugging-console
* **libc**  
  Except of some IMO not very important things like locale, math and so on,
  most of a C standard library exists by now.
* **libcpp**  
  The C++ standard library isn't that complete as the libc. But the most basic
  things like string, iostreams, vector, list, tuple, map, algorithm and a few
  other things are available (some of them are a bit simpler than the standard
  specifies it). That means, one can develop applications with the library when
  one doesn't need the more exotic stuff ;)
* **libgui**  
  The GUI-library isn't finished yet, but does already provide things like
  basic controls, layout-manager, BMP-support, event-system (keypresses, ...)
  and so on. It is written in C++, which was one of the main reason to provide
  C++-support in Escape.
* **drivers**  
  Escape has some architecture-specific drivers and some common drivers that
  are architecture- independent. Currently, there are:
    * common
        * fs: The filesystem. Has a nearly complete ext2-rev0 fs and a iso9660
          fs. Additionally it manages mount-points.
        * uimng: multiplexes input- and output-devices between its clients.
	  A client gets an UI which supplies him with keyboard- and mouse-
	  events and provides him a screen. Both text- and graphical interfaces
	  are supported. uimng has keyboard-shortcuts for creating UIs and
	  switching between them.
        * vterm: A text-interface client of uimng that provides a layer of
	  abstraction for user-processes that are textbased.
        * winmng: A GUI client of uimng that Manages all existing windows. Gets
	  keyboard- and mouse-events from uimng and forwards it to the
	  corresponding application.
        * random/null/zero: Like /dev/{random,null,zero} in e.g. Linux
    * x86
        * ata: Reading and writing from/to ATA/ATAPI-devices. It supports
          PIO-mode and DMA, LBA28 and LBA48.
        * rtc: Provides the current date and time.
        * keyb: Gets notified about keyboard-interrupts, converts the
          scancodes to keycodes and broadcasts them to all clients.
        * mouse: Gets notified about mouse-interrupts and broadcasts them to
	  all clients.
        * pci: Collects the available PCI-devices and gives others access to
          them. This is e.g. used by ata to find the IDE-controller.
        * speaker: Produces beeps with the PC-speaker with a specified
          frequency and duration.
        * vesa: An output-device for uimng that supports both text-modes and
	  graphical modes. It uses the BIOS via VM86-mode to get and set video
	  modes. Clients establish a shared-memory for the screen and send a
	  message to vesa in order to write a specific region from shm to the
	  framebuffer.
        * vga: An output-device for uimng that supports only text-mode. The
	  interface works like the one of vesa.
    * ECO32/MMIX  
      Both architectures have the same devices atm (the only difference is that
      ECO32-devices are accessed with 32-bit words and MMIX-devices with 64-bit
      words).
        * disk: the disk-driver and therefore the equivalent to ata on x86.
        * keyb: the keyboard-driver
        * rtc: the real-time-clock. This is a dummy atm, because both machines
          don't provide a real-time-clock. Therefore, a timestamp is simply
          increased once a second, starting with 0 :)
        * vga: the VGA-driver
* **user**  
  There are quite a few user-programs so that you can do something with Escape
  ;) The most important ones are:
    * initloader: Is included in the kernel and is used as the first process.
      Loads the boot-modules (disk-driver, pci (on x86 only), rtc and fs
      because we need them to load other drivers and user-apps from the disk).
      After that it replaces itself with init.
    * init: Is responsible for loading the drivers. Which drivers should be
      loaded is determined by /etc/drivers.
    * dynlink: the dynamic linker of Escape that is started by the kernel, if
      the requested application is dynamically linked. It receives the fd for
      the executable, loads all dependencies, does the relocation and
      initialization and finally jumps to the application.
    * login: Accepts username+password, sets uid, gid and further group-ids
      using /etc/users and /etc/groups, creates stdin, stdout and stderr, sets
      the env-vars CWD and USER and exchanges itself with the shell.
    * shell: The shell implements a small shell-scripting-language-interpreter
      with pipes, io-redirection, path-expansion, background-jobs, arithmetic,
      loops, if-statements, functions, variables and arrays. The interpreter
      is realized with flex and bison.
    * cat, chmod, chown, cut, date, dd, dump, grep, groups, head, kill, less,
      ln, ls, mkdir, more, mount, ps, readelf, rm, rmdir, sort, stat, sync,
      tail, time, top, umount, users, wc: The well-known UNIX-tools. They
      don't do exactly the same and are, of course, much simpler, but in
      principle they are intended for the same things.
    * ts: analogously to ps, ts lists all threads
    * power: for reboot / shutdown using init.
    * keymap: A tool to change the current keymap (us and german is available)
    * vtctrl: A tool for changing the size of the vterm, i.e. the video-mode.
    * lspci/lsacpi: list PCI-devices and ACPI tables
    * ...


Getting started
---------------

1. At first you need to build the cross-compiler for the desired
   architecture:  
   `$ cd cross`  
   `$ ./build.sh (i586|eco32|mmix)`  
   This will download gcc and binutils, build the cross-compiler and put it
   into /opt/escape-cross-$arch.
2. Now you can build escape:  
   `$ cd ../source`  
   `$ export ESC_TARGET=$arch` # choose $arch, if necessary (default: i586)  
   `$ ./b`
3. To start it, you have to choose a boot-script at boot/`$ESC_TARGET`/.
   E.g.:  
   `$ ./b run qemu-cd`
4. For further information, take a look at `./b -h`
